The OSI model is not the easiest subject to study, so I made this script to help you to understand it more effectively.

In the following sections will explore each layer of the OSI model in depth starting from layer 7 and then work down to layer 1. Common elements in each section are: 
- main terms 
-  video 
-  interactive layer functions 
-  interactive protocols. 
-  excercises at the end which can easily done given you have access to a windows command line terminal (CMD) and a browser such as chrome or firefox.
