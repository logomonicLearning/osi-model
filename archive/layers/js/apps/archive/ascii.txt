//-----ASCII--------\\
[ascii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII)

ASCII uses 7 bits to represent a character incluing numbers, letters and symbols such as &?; an control characters such as return, tab, etc. By using 7 bits, we can have a total of 2^7=128 distinct combinations*  so there is a maximum of 128 possible characters.

It uses 7 bits rather than 8 as the last bit is used for avoiding errors as parity bit. This was relevant years ago.

ASCII extended is the adition of an 8th bit which double the amount of possible combinations, that is Math.pow(2,8)== 256. This allowe the addition of extra characters such as "Ã©". it is still limited, hence the introduction of UTF-8 

A=65
a=97




//---UTF-8---\\

Unicode allowed non latin characters such as Chinese to be used.
utf-8 extends ascii 

[128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1]

A=65=1000001

//--2 Byte encoding--\\
[110xxxxxx][10xxxxxx]

x=5+6=11
that is Math.pow(2,11)=2048 possible combinations

//-3 Byte encoding-\\
[1110xxxx][10xxxxxx][10xxxxxx]
x=16
=Math.pow(2,16)

the first four nums in the first one indicate how many bytes are to follow
the first nums of each subsequent octet begins with 10=continuation byte
chinese uses 3Bytes utf-8 encoding 2Bytes in utf-16
