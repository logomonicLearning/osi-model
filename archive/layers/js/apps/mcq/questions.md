[Questions on OSI Model with answers and OSI Model Practice Questions](https://blog.oureducation.in/questionsonosimodel/)

Q1- What does the acronym OSI stand for ?
Ans- Open System Interconnection. The OSI reference model is used as a guide for teaching and understanding the way networks operate.

Q2- What are the layers of the OSI model?
Ans- Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, DataLink, Physical. An easy way to remember the order of the layers is: A-ll  P-eople  S-eem  T-o  N-eed D-ata  P-rocessing .

Q3- At which layer of the OSI model is a path decision made based upon an IP address ?
Ans- Network. At the network layer, data is transported in the form of a packet.

Q4- Which of the following takes place at the presentation layer ?
Ans- Encryption. The presentation layer encrypts data to be sent across the network, and decrypts it so that it can be accessed by the application layer on the receiving end.

Q5- Which is NOT a function of the Application layer ?
Ans- Windowing. Quality of Service and user authentication are also handled by the application layer.

Q6- Which layer of the OSI model contains the LLC sublayer and the MAC sublayer ?
Ans- Data Link Layer. The LLC and MAC sublayers allow for different layer 2 protocols to be used, such as Ethernet, Token Ring and FDDI.

Q7- How can data be transported in different layers ?
Ans- Data is transported in bits at the Physical layer . A bit is simply a binary digit. Either a 0 or a 1 . Data is transported in segments at the Data Link layer . At the data link layer, user data is encapsulated in a frame.

Q8- What is the function of Network Layer ?
Ans- The network layer establishes the route between the sender and receiver across switching points, which are typically routers. The most ubiquitous example of this layer is the IP protocol in TCP/IP. IPX, SNA and AppleTalk are other examples of routable protocols, which means that they include a network address and a station address in their addressing system. This layer is also the switching function of the dial-up telephone system. If all stations are contained within a single network segment, then the routing capability in this layer is not required.

Q9- The link for a switch connection is isolated from other data traffic except for what type of messages?
Ans- Following are the types of messages-
i. Multicast Messages – Message are sent to a specific group of hosts on the network.
ii. Broadcast Messages – Message is sent to all devices connected to the LAN.

Q10- Why are the layers of the OSI model important to the network administrator?
Ans- The Layers of OSI Model are important for the network administrator in the following manner-
i. To troubleshoot network problems by verifying functionality of each layer.
ii. In many cases it requires the network administrator to isolate at what layer the network problem   occurs.

[Reference Models  Computer Networks Questions & Answers  Sanfoundry](https://www.sanfoundry.com/computernetworksquestionsanswersreferencemodels/) an interesting choice of mcq, it also provdes the reason why after. perhaps it would be good to combine this feature with the former. 
[Quiz & Worksheet  Presentation Layer of the OSI Model | Study.com](https://study.com/academy/practice/quizworksheetpresentationlayeroftheosimodel.html) this page is silly... but theyve got good layout with the tabs at the top. this includes video, quiz and course. in my case it would make sense to have at least two tabe: couse, and questions. the questions could just be embedded into the page. there should be three buttons at the bottom. previous, next and the specific layer quiz, will just be a button which hides the current content and replaces it with the quiz which is positioned absolute. it wouldnt hurt to include a videos tab though.
[Getting to Know the OSI Model for the CCNA Exam](https://www.dummies.com/programming/certification/gettingtoknowtheosimodelfortheccnaexam/) this isnt a quiz, but theyve got some good layout and design ideas and icons worth considering. such as tip lightbulb, remember
[OSI Model Quiz 1  GoCertify](http://www.gocertify.com/quizzes/osi/osi1/Question4.html) this is quite good. it uses alert to indicate whether the qnswer was right or not but its not my style. the questions are interesting though. also, it seems like there are more steps involved because yoiu have to manually click on next. however perhaps it would be best ... wait a sec. should the user be alowed to repeat the question. no. so this ideas isnt valid as it will change the final results. it should be like sl format. you answer the question. and it tells you straight away whether you got it right or wrong but doesnt allow you to revisit.
