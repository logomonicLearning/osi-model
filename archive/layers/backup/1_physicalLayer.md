#  PHYSICAL LAYER (LAYER 1)


## KEY TERMS


- <b>Bit stream</b>:The PDU of the physical layer is bits transmitted as electrical impulses through a medium such as copper wire.
- <b>Computer Network</b>: Local Area network Wide Area network Personal Area Network
- <b>Network Topology</b>: Describe how networks are configured. Networks can be configured in various ways such as: Star; ring; bus; mesh.
- <b>Network Architecture</b>: Describes the relationship between hosts on a network. They can either be peer-to-peer or client-server 
- <b>Network Access Point (NAP)</b>: a device used by a host machine to access the network
- <b>fault tolerance</b>: a networks capacity to remain functional as a result of faults in the network. some topologies such as mesh are more fault tolerant than others such as bus.
- <b>links transmission capacity</b>: the speed at which data can be transmitted over a network usually measured in bits/second.
- <b>Switching</b>: Describes how network devices deliver data over a network. Circuit Switching is stable whereas Packet Switching is more flexible

## Intro to L1 Physical Layer

The physical includes all the hardware and physical as well as wireless devices needed to create a network such as power plugs connectors receivers transceivers. It also defines how data is physically transmitted. i.e. as electrical impulses through copper cables; as light through fiberoptic; or as wireless radio waves such as bluetooth & GSM.
<span style="display:none"> It is responsible for transmitting data between hosts on a network either through electrical impulses through copper wires light impulses through fiberoptic cables or radio waves for wireless transmission or mechanical. </span>The physical layer is usually the first layer to be investigated when troubleshooting network problems. This layer does not have any associated protocols but is crucial for creating a computer network.

<ul>
	<li><em>circuit switching</em>: dedicated circuit for every connect between the sender and receiver. connection oriented e.g. traditional phone call. good for real-time communication</li>
<li>	<em>packet switching</em>: all the data is split into chunks and may traverse different routes to the target destination arriving at different times. more flexible and efficient fault tolerant.</li></ul>


## Types of Access Network

As discussed data can be transmitted through various mediums. see the table below for a list of common mediums. The main mediums are wired (ethernet fiberoptic) and wireless(802.11 802.15 GSM).

Physical connections are made between nodes and/or infrastructure devices (hubs switches routers) by various types of copper or fiber cable. 802.3 is a technology that supports the IEEE 802.1 network architecture. 802.3 also defines LAN access method using CSMA/CD.</td>

## [NETWORK Topologies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSKdjjw5zow)

Network Topology describes the layout of devices connected on a network. topologies can be described based on their physical layout or logical layout (how data flows through the network:

## Networking aRCHITECTURE 
<span style="display:none">Network architecture is a framework for the specification of a network's physical components and their functional organization and configuration its operational principles and procedures as well as communication protocols used.The type of protocol used by an application depends on the type of application architecture being used. 
</span>
Network architecture describes the structure and classification of a distributed application. For example the applications architecture of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) has been termed the Intelligent Network. There are any number of specific classifications but all lie on a continuum between the dumb network (e.g. Internet) and the intelligent network (e.g. the telephone network).

A popular example of such usage of the term in distributed applications as well as PVCs (permanent virtual circuits) is the organization of nodes in peer-to-peer (P2P) services and networks. P2P networks usually implement overlay networks running over an underlying physical or logical network. These overlay networks may implement certain organizational structures of the nodes according to several distinct models the network architecture of the system

			<td>The most common architecture in which many clients (remote processors) request and receive service from a centralized server (host computer). Client computers provide an interface to allow a computer user to request services of the server and to display the results the server returns. This is used by data centres/cloud computing. protocols used by this layer include DNS and DHCP. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTzCUA4suPs">big data internet of things cloud</a></td>
