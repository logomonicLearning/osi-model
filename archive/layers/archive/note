There exists an Internet standard for encapsulating IPv4 traffic in IEEE 802.2 LLC SAP/SNAP frames.
[12] It is almost never implemented on Ethernet, although it is used on
- FDDI,
- Token Ring,
- IEEE 802.11 (with the exception of the 5.9 GHz band, where it uses EtherType)[13] and
- other IEEE 802 LANs.


IEEE 802.2 LLC SAP/SNAP frames  to transmit the following over ethernet:
- token ring
- IEEE 802.11
- other IEEE 802 LANs such as:
- IPv6  (almost never used.)
- IPv4 (almost never used.)
