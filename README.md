# Introduction to the OSI Model

The OSI model is not the easiest subject to learn, with all its layers, functions, protocols and other details which can overwhelm anyone when learning it for the first time. This script is my attempt at making a silver bullet to ease the learning process. It contains some major key works, interactive diagrams and videos.

Any feedback would be much appreciated
